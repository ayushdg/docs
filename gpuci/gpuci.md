## Overview

[gpuCI](http://gpuci.gpuopenanalytics.com) is the name for our GPU-backed CI service based on a [custom plugin](https://github.com/gpuopenanalytics/remote-docker-plugin) and Jenkins. This allows us to use Docker [containers](https://github.com/rapidsai/gpuci-build-environment) as the build environment for testing [RAPIDS](http://rapids.ai/) projects through the use of [nvidia-docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker) for GPU pass-through to the containers.

## Process

For new pull requests (PRs) and pushes to branches trigger jobs on the [gpuCI](http://gpuci.gpuopenanalytics.com) server to build from source and run the included tests. The results are available on the server itself, or if triggered by a PR they are embedded in the PR with the high level result and a link for detailed build information.

## Triggers

### Push to a branch

Any push to a branch triggers a gpuCI job that builds and tests the current code, linking and showing the results as a build status icon on the README

[![Build Status](https://gpuci.gpuopenanalytics.com/buildStatus/icon?job=gpuCI%2Fcudf%2Fbranches%2Fcudf-master)](https://gpuci.gpuopenanalytics.com/view/gpuCI%20-%20build-master/job/gpuCI/job/cudf/job/branches/job/cudf-master/)

### Open PR or Update PR

When a new PR is opened or an existing one has been updated, gpuCI will trigger a build and embed the results of the build into the status of the PR.

> **NOTE:** There may be a request in the form of a comment on the PR of `Can one of the admins verify this patch?` from gpuCI. If this appears one of the members of the RAPDIS team needs to respond to approve the PR. See the commands list below for available commands.

### Comment on PR

Comments with the text `rerun tests` are used in a PR to manually trigger a retest; as the code has not changed.

This is helpful when trying to troubleshoot issues with the build process and/or to see if the encountered error is persistent. Use gpuCI to examine the _Console Output_ to find more detail.

## Commands

### Admins - Approving PR builds

* To approve PR author for just the current PR, comment the command
  * `ok to test`
* To approve PR author for all PRs in the future, comment the command
  * `add to whitelist`

### Users

* To manually trigger tests in a PR, comment the command
  * `rerun tests`
* To skip CI testing (for documentation changes) add the following to the title of the PR
  * `[skip-ci]`

## Help

If you run into issues and need help with gpuCI, please file an issue in the repo that represents the code base with the issue and start the issue title `[gpuCI]`
